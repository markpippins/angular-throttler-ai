# `ChatComponent` Documentation (`/src/components/chat/Gemini.md`)

This component provides a chat interface within a tab in the `SidebarComponent`.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Conditional UI:** The primary feature of this component is to check for the presence of a Gemini API key in the environment (`process.env.API_KEY`).
    -   If the key is present, it displays a fully functional chat interface.
    -   If the key is *not* present, it hides the chat UI and instead displays an informative message telling the user that the feature is unavailable.
2.  **Chat Interface:** When enabled, it provides a standard chat UI with:
    -   A scrollable area for displaying the conversation history.
    -   A text input area for the user to type messages.
    -   A send button.
3.  **State Management:** It manages the list of chat messages and the current user input using Angular Signals.
4.  **Boilerplate Logic:** As an initial implementation, it contains mock logic to simulate a conversation. When a user sends a message, it adds the message to the history and, after a delay, adds a canned response.

## API and Data Flow

-   **Inputs:** None.
-   **Outputs:** None.
-   **Dependencies:** It has no external dependencies and manages its own state. It directly checks the `process.env` global, which is assumed to be populated by the build environment.
